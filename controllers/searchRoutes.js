//How can add a get route that will search and display users without a full input
    //I want a dropdown that will show users that fit those paramters as the user is typing
    //otherise users need to know the other users usernames perfectly which is not a reasonable assumption
    //How can we populate that modal in real time?
    //Can we have a dynamic query to SQL that is constantly updating and finding any user thats username contains "x" characters?
